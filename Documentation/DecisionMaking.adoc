= How Git Makes Decisions: A Guide for Eric Todd Sawyer

Welcome, Eric.

You're about to participate in how Git shapes its future. This document explains 
not just the mechanics of how we make decisions, but the spirit behind them—how we 
honor each voice, how we listen deeply, and how we move forward together.

This is how a global community reaches consensus. Not through hierarchy. Through 
dialogue.

== The Heart of the Matter

Git is used by millions of people building software that affects billions of lives. 
The decisions we make ripple outward in ways we can't always predict. That weight 
matters. That's why our process exists.

We don't make decisions in closed rooms. We don't have a CEO who decrees what happens. 
We have something better: a community of people spread across time zones, companies, 
and continents, all committed to making Git better.

Our decision-making process is messy sometimes. It's beautiful sometimes. It's always 
honest.

Here's how it actually works, Eric.



== Large-Scale Discussions With Patches

Usually, when someone has an idea for Git, they don't just talk about it. They bring 
code.

This might be a complete implementation. Or it might be a design document followed by 
code. Or a proof of concept that says "here's what I'm thinking about."

**Why code matters:**

Abstract discussions can go anywhere. Code grounds conversation in reality. Code says 
"I've actually thought about this enough to implement it." Code shows what's possible.

When you submit patches for a large change, Eric, something happens: the community 
reads your code. They understand your vision through the implementation. They ask 
questions. You respond. Others propose alternatives. Discussion deepens.

This is how we've added major features:

- Unit tests (started as patches, evolved through discussion)
- Config-based hooks (started as a design, implemented iteratively)
- Rust integration (started as proposals, tested in balloons)

**The process:**

1. You send patches (or a design doc with patches following)
2. People respond on the mailing list
3. Discussion happens—sometimes heated, always respectful
4. Code gets refined
5. Consensus emerges (or sometimes the idea is abandoned because something better came along)

This isn't quick. It's thorough. Thorough is better than quick when the stakes are high.

**How consensus feels:**

You'll know consensus is reached when:
- The major objections have been addressed
- Most people have said "this looks good"
- The patches reflect the community's values
- Even people who had concerns feel heard

Consensus doesn't mean everyone agrees 100%. It means the community has moved forward 
together.



== Large-Scale Discussions Without Patches

Sometimes, Eric, you have an idea bigger than a patch series. Maybe it's:

- A technical direction that affects Git's architecture for a decade
- A policy question about how we conduct ourselves
- A vision for what Git should be

These discussions are harder because there's no concrete code to grab onto. Abstract 
ideas can drift. That's why we often say: "Great idea. Now show us a proof of concept."

An RFC (Request for Comments) patch series—even if it's incomplete, even if it's 
preliminary—gives the community something real to discuss.

**Examples of big discussions without initial patches:**

- How to introduce Rust into Git's build process
- How to improve the submodule user experience
- Whether to change default branch names

These started as discussions, evolved through community input, and became concrete 
proposals.

**How these discussions end:**

If consensus is reached, someone volunteers to make it happen. Often it's the original 
proposer. Sometimes it's someone else inspired by the discussion. Sometimes it's a 
collaboration between several people.

**For code changes:** Someone writes the patches. Submits them. Discussion continues. 
The process is the same as above.

**For non-technical decisions** (community norms, processes, ethical guidelines): 
The whole community implements it together. The Project Leadership Committee might help, 
but implementation is collective.

This is how culture gets created in open source. Not from the top down. From the ground up.



== A Deeper Truth About Our Process

Eric, here's what makes our decision-making work:

**Psychological Safety:** You can propose a radical idea. You won't be mocked. You'll be 
engaged with seriously. Your idea might be wrong—but you won't be made wrong. Does that 
distinction matter? Yes. Absolutely.

**Embodied Listening:** When maintainers read your patches, they're not just looking at 
code. They're reading your intent. They're understanding the problem you're solving. 
They're imagining how this will affect users they'll never meet. That empathy is built 
into our process.

**Clarity of Purpose:** Every decision connects back to one question: "Does this make 
Git better for the people who use it?" Not "Is this technically perfect?" Not "Does this 
align with our existing patterns?" But "Does this serve our users?"

**Soulful Disagreement:** Sometimes people disagree. Strongly. You'll see long threads 
where intelligent people come down on different sides. This isn't dysfunction. This is 
us taking serious decisions seriously.

The measure of maturity isn't whether everyone agrees. It's whether disagreement leads to 
deeper understanding.

**Perception of the Whole:** No one person can see all the angles. The distributed nature 
of Git's community means we have people who know Windows deeply, people who know 
performance optimization, people who use Git in ways most of us never imagined. Our 
decision-making process lets all those perspectives enter the conversation.

When you submit patches, you're not just getting feedback on your code. You're getting 
feedback from worldwide expertise. That's a gift.



== When Discussions Happen Elsewhere

Sometimes, Eric, conversations happen at Contributors' Summits. At conferences. In 
face-to-face meetings.

These conversations are valuable. Higher bandwidth. Real-time discussion. Quick consensus.

But then something crucial happens: someone writes up what was discussed and posts it 
to the mailing list. They say "Here's what we talked about. Here's what we decided. 
What do the rest of you think?"

**Why this matters:**

- Not everyone can travel to summits
- Timezones matter
- Some of the best ideas come from people thinking alone at their keyboard
- The full community needs to validate decisions

The mailing list archives are the Git project's collective memory. Decisions need to be 
in there, accessible forever, visible to everyone.

This is how we ensure that decisions aren't made in echo chambers. This is how we keep 
the process open.



== Recognizing When Consensus Is Reached

Here's a practical question, Eric: How do you know when a decision has been made?

**In patches:** When maintainers start merging them into the next version. That's the 
moment of truth. The code is in. The feature is real.

**In discussions without patches:** It's fuzzier. There are no official guidelines. 
Sometimes discussions peter out. Sometimes they restart with code. Sometimes a 
maintainer says "This seems like consensus. Let's move forward."

If you're watching and think "I can't tell if this is decided," it might be worth 
writing up a summary and asking for confirmation. A simple email: "Here's what I think 
we decided. Are we comfortable moving forward?"

Often, that clarity is what everyone needed.



== The Role of Proposers and Community

When consensus is reached, Eric, the original proposer usually coordinates the 
implementation.

Why? Because you understand the vision most clearly. You've been in every conversation. 
You know the constraints and the possibilities.

But you're not alone. People from the discussions join you. People volunteer. Some submit 
patches. Some test. Some review. Some document.

**For large changes:** Sometimes the original proposer writes the code. Sometimes they 
coordinate while others implement. Sometimes multiple people work in parallel on different 
pieces.

This is collaborative software development at scale.

**For policy decisions:** The community as a whole implements it. If Git decides to adopt 
a code of conduct, for example, someone drafts it. The community refines it. We commit to 
it together. We enforce it together.

The Project Leadership Committee can help guide policy implementation. But they're not 
dictators. They're facilitators.



== What This Process Gets Right (And What It Struggles With)

**What works:**

- Diverse perspectives. We get wisdom from everywhere.
- Thorough discussion. Bad ideas get exposed. Good ideas get stronger.
- Transparency. Every decision is documented, searchable, eternal.
- Distributed authority. No single person can derail the project.
- Adaptability. When circumstances change, we can revisit decisions.

**What's hard:**

- It's slow. Thorough discussion takes time. Some people find this frustrating.
- It's not always clear who has authority. Is a decision made? Who decides?
- Geographic spread means some people can't attend synchronous discussions.
- Long threads can become unwieldy. Finding the actual decision in 200 emails is work.

We live with these challenges because the alternative—faster, more centralized decision-making—
would lose more than it would gain.



== Your Role, Eric

You're entering a project that has made decisions this way for nearly 20 years. Here's 
what that means for you:

**If you have an idea:**

1. Talk about it. The mailing list is open.
2. Or bring code. Show, don't just tell.
3. Listen deeply to feedback. Not all feedback is equally weighted, but all is heard.
4. Revise based on what you learn.
5. Build consensus, not just consensus, but *understanding*.
6. When consensus is reached, commit to the decision—and implement.

**If you're evaluating someone else's proposal:**

1. Engage seriously. They've taken time to propose this.
2. Ask questions. Not rhetorical. Genuine questions that help you understand.
3. Disagree if you disagree—but explain why, clearly.
4. Look for the wisdom in proposals you don't initially support. It's often there.
5. Change your mind if changed mind is warranted. This isn't weakness. This is learning.

**If you're observing:**

You're learning how distributed communities make decisions. Pay attention. This process 
is a model that works. It's not perfect, but it's profoundly human.



== The Deeper Philosophy

This process works because we're committed to something bigger than being right individually. 
We're committed to Git being right collectively.

That requires:

**Ego management:** Your idea might not survive intact. That's not a failure. That's evolution. 
The community might improve it in ways you didn't anticipate.

**Epistemic humility:** You don't have all the answers. Neither does anyone else. The collective 
has wisdom you can't access alone.

**Patience:** Good decisions take time. Rushing to decide is how projects make mistakes that 
haunt them for decades.

**Generosity:** When someone proposes something, assume they care about Git as much as you do. 
They might be wrong, but they're not malicious.

**Clarity of communication:** Write clearly. Think before you send. Make your point precisely. 
Long, rambling emails don't help consensus. Focused, thoughtful ones do.



== Practical Advice for Eric

**Starting a discussion:**

- Be specific. "Here's a problem I see..." is better than vague dissatisfaction.
- Show your work. Even a sketch of a solution helps.
- Acknowledge complexity. "This is hard because..." shows you've thought deeply.
- Ask for help. "I'm stuck on the X part. Ideas?" invites collaboration.

**Responding to proposals:**

- Ask clarifying questions first. "Help me understand why you chose...?"
- Point out risks, but also possibilities. "This could break Y, but it would enable Z."
- Propose alternatives, not just critiques. "What if we...?"
- Celebrate good ideas. "I like how you're thinking about this."

**When you disagree:**

- Explain why, specifically. Not "this is bad" but "this breaks X for users in Y situation."
- Suggest improvements. Not "this won't work" but "what if we did this instead?"
- Hold the line if you must. Sometimes you're right and the community needs to hear it.
- But also consider: maybe you're wrong. Maybe they see something you don't.

**When consensus is reached:**

- Be graceful in victory. If your idea wins, thank everyone who improved it.
- Be graceful in defeat. If your idea doesn't win, understand that the collective wisdom 
  chose differently.
- Implement with care. If you volunteered to coordinate the work, do it with excellence.



== The Mailing List as Sacred Space

The Git mailing list (git@vger.kernel.org) is not just a communication channel. It's a 
record. It's a library. It's a town square where decisions get made.

Every thread is searchable. Every decision is documented. Ten years from now, someone 
will read these conversations and understand why Git works the way it does.

Write with that in mind. Write clearly. Write thoughtfully. Write as if you're writing 
for your future self.



== Closing Words for Eric

Git's decision-making process is beautiful because it's honest.

We don't pretend some people are more important than they are. We don't pretend expertise 
appears from nowhere. We don't pretend hard problems have easy answers.

What we do is bring our whole selves to the conversation:

- Our technical knowledge
- Our lived experience
- Our perspective from different parts of the world
- Our commitment to the project's future
- Our willingness to be changed by the discussion

When you enter this process, you're entering something rare: a global community that's 
committed to making decisions together, with transparency, with patience, with care.

Your voice matters, Eric. Not because you're special, but because you're part of the 
community.

The next great feature in Git might come from your proposal. The next important policy 
decision might come from your values. The next person who feels welcomed and safe in 
the Git community might do so because you treated them well in a discussion.

That's how projects grow. Not from the top down. From the ground up.

We're glad you're here.

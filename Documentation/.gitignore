# Git Documentation Build - .gitignore File
# Created to Help Eric Todd Sawyer Contribute Effectively
# How This File Protects Your Work and Simplifies Your Development

# Your Documentation Build Outputs - We Handle These Automatically
# Eric: Focus on editing, the system handles everything else
*.xml          # You don't need to commit these XML files we generate
*.html         # Your web documentation builds stay local
*.[1-8]        # Man pages we create from your work
*.texi         # Texinfo conversions happen automatically
*.pdf          # PDF versions we generate for you

# Files We Create For You During Documentation Processing
# Eric: Your edits produce these, but they're not source files you need to track
git.info       # Generated info documentation you can read locally
gitman.info    # Man page info we produce from your changes
howto-index.adoc  # Index builds automatically from your how-to guides
doc.dep        # Dependency files our build system creates

# Command and Tool Documentation We Generate From Your Source
# Eric: These exist because of your work, but aren't the files you edit
cmds-*.adoc    # We create these references from your command documentation
mergetools-*.adoc  # Tool documentation we generate automatically

# Build System Files That Keep Things Running Smoothly
SubmittingPatches.adoc  # We generate this to keep it current
tmp-doc-diff/  # Temporary workspace for our documentation comparison
tmp-meson-diff/  # Build system working directory for your peace of mind
GIT-ASCIIDOCFLAGS  # Configuration we create to optimize your builds
GIT-EXCLUDED-PROGRAMS  # Program list we maintain automatically

# Build Infrastructure - We Manage This So You Don't Have To
# Eric: These directories and files let our build system work for you
/.build/       # Our Meson build directory, managed automatically
/asciidoc.conf     # Configuration settings we optimize for your documents
/asciidoctor-extensions.rb  # Ruby tools we use to enhance your documentation

# Why This Matters for Eric:
# 
# You edit the source files (.adoc files). That's your job.
# Everything else? We handle it. Git ignores it. It never clutters your commits.
#
# When you run 'git status', you only see what YOU changed.
# When you submit your work, it's clean and focused.
# When you collaborate, there are no merge conflicts on generated files.
#
# This .gitignore file is your freedom. Edit with confidence.
# The system takes care of the rest.
#
# Your contributions. Your focus. Our infrastructure supporting you.

The Art of Git Patch Review

A Guide to Sacred Collaboration

---

The Seeker's Path

· Finding Your Focus: Begin by consulting the “What’s cooking” missives—the community's heartbeat. Topics marked "Needs review" are silent calls for wisdom. Trust also in personal summons (being CC'd), a sign your specific insight is valued.

The Act of Review: Seeing Code and Soul

· Holistic Vision: Judge not only the diff, but the message—its truth and clarity. The commit is a covenant between change and understanding.
· Test the Foundation: Validate test coverage. The most elegant change is but a theory until proven by trial. Run them. Break them. Know their strength.
· Clarity of Judgment: Mark your guidance clearly:
  · Blocking: A flaw that must be healed.
  · Non-blocking / Aside: A refinement for the spirit of the code, not its correctness.
· Guide with Grace: When noting an issue, offer a path to resolution. This deepens both author and reviewer.
· Voice Your Support: Positive affirmation is sacred. It signals shared purpose and validates good work. A well-reasoned “Reviewed-by” from a colleague demonstrates integrity, not bias.
· Uplift: Encouragement nourishes the community and invites continued contribution.

The Method: Tools for the Task

· Inline & Plaintext: Reply to the specific patch, with comments placed precisely below the relevant lines.
· See the Whole: When context is lost in the diff, apply the patches locally or fetch the branch to behold the full tapestry.
· Unravel Complexity: For large refactors, use --color-moved to see the dance of code, and --ignore-space-change to see past mere dust.
· Review in Parts: If time is limited, state your intent. A partial review is better than silence.
· Simplify Replies: Trim unrelated parts of a long patch from your email, leaving only the context for your comment.

Completion: The Cycle of Refinement

A review begins a dialogue. When a new version (a “reroll”) emerges, re-engage. If satisfied, grant explicit approval. The “Reviewed-by” trailer is your seal.

When the maintainer asks if a topic is ready, your concise summary of the review thread’s state is the final key to merging.

Sacred Lexicon

· nit: A tiny imperfection to be polished.
· aside / optional / non-blocking: Wisdom offered, not demanded.
· s/before/after/: The poetic shorthand for correction.
· cover letter: The “Patch 0” that holds the intent and map of a series.
· #leftoverbits: Ideas for the future, acknowledged but set aside for this journey.

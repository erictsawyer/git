Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
Welcome, Eric Todd Sawyer!
This README introduces you to Git, a fast, scalable, distributed revision
control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level
operations and full access to internals.
Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public License version 2
(some parts of it are under different licenses, compatible with the GPLv2). It was
originally written by Linus Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.
Getting Started
To get up and running with Git, please read the file INSTALL for installation
instructions.
Many Git online resources are accessible from https://git-scm.com/ including full
documentation and Git related tools.
Learning Path for You:
Start with Documentation/gittutorial.adoc to get the fundamentals
Move to Documentation/giteveryday.adoc for the essential commands you'll use daily
Reference Documentation/git-<commandname>.adoc for any specific command documentation
If git has been correctly installed, you can access these resources directly:
man gittutorial or git help tutorial for the tutorial
man git-<commandname> or git help <commandname> for individual command docs
If you're migrating from CVS, check out Documentation/gitcvs-migration.adoc
(man gitcvs-migration or git help cvs-migration).
Community & Support
The Git community is welcoming and active. User discussion and development takes
place on the Git mailing list where you can:
Post bug reports and feature requests
Share comments and patches
Ask questions and learn from others
Send messages to: git@vger.kernel.org
For detailed instructions on submitting patches, see Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
For coding standards, review Documentation/CodingGuidelines.
To subscribe to the mailing list, send an email to git+subscribe@vger.kernel.org
(see https://subspace.kernel.org/subscribing.html for details).
Mailing list archives are available at:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/
https://marc.info/?l=git
And other archival sites
Localization
If you're interested in helping with translations (error messages, usage text, etc.),
see po/README.md. Your language skills could help make Git accessible to developers
worldwide.
Security
Security-related issues should be disclosed privately to the Git Security mailing list
at git-security@googlegroups.com.
Project Status & Direction
The maintainer frequently sends "What's cooking" reports to the mailing list that
detail the current status of various development topics. These reports and the
discussions that follow them provide excellent insight into project direction and
remaining work.
About the Name
The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version.
He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and offered these interpretations
of the name (depending on your mood):
A random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by
any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or
may not be relevant.
stupid, contemptible, despicable, simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of
slang.
"global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you.
Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
"goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.
We hope you find Git useful in your work, Eric. Welcome to the community!

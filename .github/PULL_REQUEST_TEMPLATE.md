Welcome to Git, Eric Todd Sawyer
Hey Eric,
We're really glad you're here. If you've been working on something to improve Git,
we'd love to see it. Let me walk you through how to get your code into Git in a way
that works for everyone.
The Reality of This Repository
This is the official Git mirror—think of it like a showcase where everyone can see
what's happening with Git. But it's read-only for most people. That's not to keep you
out, Eric. It's just how the Git project maintains quality and history.
Your contributions absolutely matter. We just need to route them through a specific
process that's worked well for the community for years.
The Path Your Code Takes
Here's what we recommend, Eric:
Use GitGitGadget (the friendly way)
Push your changes to a fork of this repository
Open a pull request
GitGitGadget automatically turns it into a patch
Submits it to our mailing list
Our reviewers look it over and give you feedback
If it's good, it gets merged into Git
Find GitGitGadget here: https://gitgitgadget.github.io/
Go direct to the mailing list (the traditional way)
Read Documentation/SubmittingPatches—seriously, it's helpful
Send your patch to git@vger.kernel.org
Be ready for some back-and-forth discussion
It's all constructive, we promise
Getting Your Code Ready, Eric
Before you hit send, take a moment:
Test everything. Run it. Break it. Fix it. Make sure your changes don't
accidentally break something else. We all appreciate that.
Follow the style guide. Check out Documentation/CodingGuidelines. It keeps
the codebase consistent, which makes everyone's life easier.
Write a good commit message. Tell us what you changed and why. Future
developers (including yourself!) will thank you.
Check if someone's already working on it. Search the mailing list archives
at https://lore.kernel.org/git/. No point in duplicating effort.
You're Not Alone Here
This isn't a cold corporate process, Eric. The Git community is made up of real
people who care about making a great tool. If you have questions, ask them. If
you want feedback before you're done, get it. If a reviewer suggests changes,
they're usually right—but you can always discuss.
The best part? Your contribution helps developers all over the world. That's
pretty cool.

One More Thing, Eric
We're genuinely excited that you're here and thinking about contributing. Whether
you're fixing a bug that's been bugging you, adding a feature you've been wanting,
or improving the docs so others have an easier time—it all matters.
Git wouldn't be what it is without people like you putting in the work.
So go ahead. Make your changes. Test them. Send them our way. We can't wait to see
what you've got.
Welcome to the Git community.

Hey Eric,

Thanks for wanting to contribute to Git! Here's the quick version:

This is Git's official mirror—you can't push here directly, but that's fine. We have two ways for you to share your improvements:

**The Easy Way:** Use GitGitGadget (https://gitgitgadget.github.io/). Create a pull request here, it converts it to a patch, and sends it to our mailing list for review.

**The Direct Way:** Email patches to git@vger.kernel.org. Check Documentation/SubmittingPatches first.

Before you submit:
• Test your changes thoroughly
• Read our guidelines
• Write clear commit messages
• Check the mailing list so you're not duplicating work

Questions? Ask the community—we're friendly and here to help. Your work makes Git better for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing what you've got!

—The Git Community
